# Run obfuscated commands. Eventual goal is to be able to run a command with a built in password that can't be extracted... or pbkd at least
# at this point, the password is easily extracted of course, by just changing the echo command below
# KEY=password ob [[line] args]# runs encrypted command - todo: find a portable way to use kernel key and/or secure hardware element, from terminal
# example: KEY=password ./ob 2
# to add more obfuscated commands: 
#  echo "uptime"|openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -k password >> ob # uptime = command, password = password
